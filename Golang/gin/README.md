## Gin-Gonic

Gin-Gonic is a HTTP framework used with Golang that can help developers create API routes

Here is the basic documentation: https://godoc.org/github.com/gin-gonic/gin

Gin-Gonic implements the httprouter package (different from the standard net/http package which has the default mux), 
which uses a more efficient mux architecture for highly performant and scalable routing.
